# Product-ivity

- Nuget package - Microsoft.ASPNET.WebAPI
                - system.net.http

The product grid lies in the ABOUT section of the program.

I just slammed everything in the template to get it to work. Biggest struggle was to just get the program up and running. 

Create/edit isn't functional at all. only get. 

No idea how to set up integration and unit tests from scratch. And also this is a mess. I'm sorry. I really wanted to do better.
